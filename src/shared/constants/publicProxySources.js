/**
 * Public free-proxy list sources for one-click proxy pool import.
 *
 * Shared between the import API route (server) and the dashboard modal
 * (client) so capability gating never drifts between the two.
 *
 * Runtime constraint: undici's ProxyAgent (open-sse/utils/proxyFetch.js)
 * dispatches http/https and socks5/socks schemes only — socks4 and the
 * Xray share-link families (vmess/vless/trojan/ss/ssr/mtproto) cannot be
 * routed by a pool entry, so sources never offer them.
